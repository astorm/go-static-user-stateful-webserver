# go-static-user-stateful-webserver

This project will, eventually, be a simple static web server that serves content dynamically based on Basic HTTP Authentication.  Its specific purpose is to provide stateful composer repositories to a user and/or customer base.

I suspect this is only of interest to me, but if you've stumbled across this project, and see something that looks dumb, broken, or "wrong" from an idiomatic go perspective, issues and pull requests are welcome. 

Development Log
--------------------------------------------------
Follow along as I make really dumb beginner experiments and mistakes with go. 

- <s>Look! I reimplemented basic HTTP auth functionality that I didn't realize existed in go!</s>

- OK, using `request.BasicAuth` now.
